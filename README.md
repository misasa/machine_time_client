# machine_time_client

Ruby package to connect `machine_time` object and machine-gazer's RESTful web service.

# Description 
A client for interacting with [machine-gazer][] by REST.  machine-gazer REST API follows
the Rails's RESTful conventions, so this gem uses [ActiveResource][]
to interact with the machine-gazer REST API.  This gem allows Ruby developers
to programmatically  access the API and provides some useful functions
to manage `machine_time` object on the machine-gazer programmatically.

This is referred by [gem package -- godigo](https://github.com/misasa/godigo "follow instruction").

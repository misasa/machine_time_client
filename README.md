# gem package -- machine_time_client

Ruby library to connect `machine_time` object and machine-gazer's
RESTful web service.

# Description 

Ruby package to connect `machine_time` object and machine-gazer's
RESTful web service.  A client for interacting with a machine-gazer by [rails project -- machine_time](https://github.com/misasa/machine_time)
by REST.  The machine-gazer REST API follows the Rails's RESTful
conventions, so this gem uses [ActiveResource](https://github.com/rails/activeresource/) to interact with the
machine-gazer REST API.  This gem allows Ruby developers to
programmatically access the API and provides some useful functions to
manage `machine_time` object on the machine-gazer programmatically.

See
[gem package -- godigo](https://github.com/misasa/godigo "follow instruction")
that refers to this library.
